Contributing
============

If you find an issue, please report it. If you wish to make a code
contribution, please note the following.

-   Code (JavaScript at least) should use tabs for indents (for display,
    we recommend a tab width of four characters).
-   For those with commit access to this repo: the master branch is used
    to accept PRs only; do not commit directly to master.

Please follow this process for code contributions...

1.  Choose or file an issue (check that no duplicates exist first).
2.  Fork the repo and make a branch for the feature/fix there (or just
    make a branch in this repo, if you have commit access).
3.  Implement your feature/fix and check it works in at least IE10 and
    IE11. In any commit messages, be sure to [mention the relevant
    issue(s), so they'll be closed
    automatically](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
    when the PR is accepted.
4.  Make a PR from your feature/fix branch to the master branch of this
    repo.

Thanks!
